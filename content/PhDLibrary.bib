  abstract = {This article aims to shed light on the meaning of complexity for risk assessment of sociotechnical systems. The point of departure is that complexity is related to uncertainty as an indication of confidence in risk assessment. Complexity science points to limitations in risk analysis that owe to a mismatch between the nature of sociotechnical systems and how we approach them in search of prediction and control. Complexity complements uncertainty in three ways: as a source of uncertainty, as an additional type of uncertainty concerning deviations from what is designed, planned or assumed, and as an overall indication of limitations in the analysis with respect to potential for surprise. A new framework is suggested to clarify and make the concept of practical value to risk assessment. The framework consists of a definition, a conceptual map, an ontological and epistemological position, and a set of indicators. Complexity is explained in the conjunction of an analyst, a system, and a chosen model and is conditioned on the state of knowledge and the assessment context. It is epistemic in the sense that it resides in the analyst’s understanding of the system and not in the system as such. A challenging implication is that complexity is relative in many respects, but this also provides opportunities for approaching it in risk assessment. The indicators can help to acknowledge, reduce, and describe complexity in pre-assessment, risk analysis, and risk evaluation.},

  pages    = {403-417},
  volume   = {222},
  abstract = {A basic assumption often made in risk- and reliability-based inspection planning is that a Bayesian approach can be used. This implies that probabilities of failure can be updated in a consistent way when new information (from inspections and repairs) becomes available. The Bayesian approach and a no-crack detection assumption imply that the inspection time intervals usually become longer and longer with time. For ageing platforms several small cracks should be expected to be observed according to the bath-tub curve development often assumed – implying an increased risk for crack initiation (and coalescence of small cracks) and increased crack growth. This should imply shorter inspection time intervals for ageing structures. Different approaches for updating inspection plans for older installations are proposed. The most promising method consists of increasing the rate of crack initiations at the end of the expected lifetime – corresponding to a bath-tub hazard rate effect. The approach illustrated is for welded steel details in platforms. Systems effects are considered, including the use of dependence between inspection and failure events in different components for inspection planning.},

  abstract = {The present paper aims to assess the usefulness of the integration of a qualitative risk-based inspection (RBI) procedure with the modelling of Bayesian belief networks (BBNs). In such a way, qualitative RBI, usually performed following standard procedures, might still be applied, even with the lack of some necessary data. Another benefit of the proposed method is the capability to include new factors in the evaluation, overtaking the rigid structure of the procedure. The qualitative RBI was chosen for its simple and clear structure, while the choice of the BBN formalism was made because of its flexibility and power to represent discontinuous variables. Bayesian formalism, moreover, allows a quick and easy extension of the model with additional variables. As a result, a BBN modelling a qualitative RBI was constructed. In the network, all of the RBI variables were included, as well as new external variables. An application for a chemical plant was tested in order to prove that BBNs can profitably model qualitative RBIs and can go beyond its rigid structure with the addition of new variables.},

  abstract      = {© 2017 Elsevier Inc. While there is currently a lot of enthusiasm about “big data” useful data is usually “small” and expensive to acquire. In this paper, we present a new paradigm of learning partial differential equations from small data. In particular, we introduce hidden physics models, which are essentially data-efficient learning machines capable of leveraging the underlying laws of physics, expressed by time dependent and nonlinear partial differential equations, to extract patterns from high-dimensional data generated from experiments. The proposed methodology may be applied to the problem of learning, system identification, or data-driven discovery of partial differential equations. Our framework relies on Gaussian processes, a powerful tool for probabilistic inference over functions, that enables us to strike a balance between model complexity and data fitting. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated through a variety of canonical problems, spanning a number of scientific domains, including the Navier–Stokes, Schrödinger, Kuramoto–Sivashinsky, and time dependent linear fractional equations. The methodology provides a promising new direction for harnessing the long-standing developments of classical methods in applied mathematics and mathematical physics to design learning machines with the ability to operate in complex domains without requiring large quantities of data.},
